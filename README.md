# medlog

Medlog is a project to keep a log about the medication taken by an individual.
It also tracks the inventory of remaining medication.

All data will be stored locally and "logs" shall only be generated from data that was voluntarily offered from the user
to the user. 

## Getting Started

To get your own copy of medlog take a look at releases. The most recent stable build will help you out.

I would love to hear back. Feedback can be send via ...

If you experience issues i would love for you to share them. I would suggest you to file a bug report against Issues.
Remember to redact private information you would not want to share publicly. If you feel it is neccessary to share private info
consider sending me a email. 

### About medlog
...
I strongly believe that this kind of information should only be handled in an open source context.

The intake of medication usualy is not timed perfectly or always on schedule.
Medlog shall compensate for that. 

Starting and stopping a medication should not need the creation of a timer.

Most otc pharamceuticals arent taken regularly.
Medlog shall still be able to track and inform the user about trends.

### Features

### Future Features

- [ ] show the median daily use of a specific pharmaceutical
- [ ] inform about the need to restock based on the remaining stock
- [ ] allow for analysis, for factors that can be "easily" be influenced 
    and that will increase safety and effectiveness of treatment.
- [ ] how about exporting some / all of your intake and share it with your doc.
    - this should be implemented after data about adverse reactions are trackable.
### Localization

As of now medlog is not localized, but should be adaptable to be localized and is a future feature.
